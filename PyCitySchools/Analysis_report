PyCity Schools Analysis

Budget vs. Test Results: Higher school budgets didn't guarantee better academic performance. Schools with lower spending per student outperformed those with higher budgets.
School Size and Performance: Smaller and medium-sized schools excelled in math performance compared to large schools, with passing rates of 89-91% vs. 67%.
Charter vs. Public Schools: Charter schools outperformed public schools in all metrics. Further analysis is needed to understand whether this is due to school practices or smaller student populations.
Key Insights: Beyond funding, factors like school size and governance influence academic success. Understanding these nuances can guide improvements in public education.

Methodology: Python and Pandas were used to analyze school and student data, calculating average scores and passing rates. The analysis included breakdowns by spending, school size, and type for comprehensive insights.

1. Budget vs. Academic Performance: The analysis reveals that schools with lower spending per student ($585 or less) achieved higher overall passing rates compared to schools with higher budgets ($645-680 per student). This suggests that budget allocation alone does not guarantee a greater academic outcomes.
2. School Size and Math Performance: The data indicates that smaller and medium-sized schools consistently outperformed larger schools in math. These smaller schools had higher average math scores and a greater percentage of students passing math, showcasing the potential benefits of smaller class sizes and more personalized instruction.
